## **Section 01: Fundamental Ideas Around Microservices**

### What Is a Microservice?

A monolith contains

- Routing
- Middleware
- Business Logic
- Database access
to implement all features of our app

![](section-01/monolith-server.jpg)

A single microservice contains

- Routing
- Middleware
- Business Logic
- Database access
to implement one feature of our app

![](section-01/single-microservice.jpg)

### Data in Microservices

Data management between services

- This is the big problem of microservices, and what 90% of this course focuses on

With microservices, we store and access data in sort of strange way. Let's look at 

- how we store data: Each service gets its own database (if it needs one) 
- how we access it: Services will never, ever reach into another services database

![](section-01/store-data.jpg)
![](section-01/access-data.jpg)

Why Database-Per-Service pattern?

- We want each service to run independently of other services
![](section-01/common-database.jpg)
![](section-01/service-dependent.jpg)
- Database schema/structure might change unexpectedly
![](section-01/schema-change.jpg)
- Some services might function more efficiently with different types of DB's (sql vs nosql)

### Sync Communication Between Services

Communication Strategies Between Services
- Sync: Services communicate with each other using direct requests
- Async: Services communicate with each other using events

Notes on Sync Communication

| Pro                              | Con                                                           |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Conceptually easy to understand! | Introduces a dependency between services                      |
| Service D won't need a database! | If any inter-service request fails, the overall request fails |
|                                  | The entire request is only as fast as the slowest request     |
|                                  | Can easily introduce webs of requests                         |

### Async: Event-Based Communication

![](section-01/event-bus.jpg)

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Async: A Crazy Way of Storing Data

Service D: Code to show products ordered by a particular user
Let's refine the exact goal of this service
Service D: Given the ID of a user, show the title and image for every product they have ever ordered

### Pros and Cons of Async Communication

| Pros                                               | Cons                 |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Service D has zero dependencies on other services! | Data duplication.    |
| Service D will be extremely fast!                  | Harder to understand |

## **Section 02: A Mini-Microservices App**

### App Overview

Goals

- Get a taste of a microservices architecture
- Build as much as possible from scratch

![](section-02/app-overview-1.jpg)

What services should we create?

- For now, we will create one separate service for each resource in our app

### Common Questions Around Async Events


Wait, so you're saying we need to create a new service every time we need to join some data?!?!?!?!?!?
> Absolutely not!  In reality, might not even have posts and comments in separate services in the first place

Who cares that each service is independent?
> Independent services + the reliability that brings is one of the core reasons of using microservices in the first place

This is so over the top complicated for little benefit
> Seems that way now!  Adding in some features starts to get really easy when we use this architecture

This system won't correctly in the following scenario....
> There are some very special things we need to consider with this design.  I've got solutions for most (maybe?) of the concerns you may have

### Event Bus Overview

Event Bus

- Many different implementations. RabbitMQ, Kafka, NATS...
- Receives events, publishes them to listeners
- Many different subtle features that make async communication way easier or way harder
- We are going to build our own event bus using Express. It will not implement the vast majority of features a normal bus has.
- Yes, for our next app we will use a production grade, open source event bus

![](section-02/event-bus-overview-1.jpg)

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### A Basic Event Bus Implementation

![](section-02/event-bus-overview-2.jpg)

```javascript
// event-bus/index.js
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const axios = require('axios');

const app = express();
app.use(bodyParser.json());

app.post('/events', (req, res) => {
  const event = req.body;

  axios.post('http://localhost:4000/events', event);
  axios.post('http://localhost:4001/events', event);
  axios.post('http://localhost:4002/events', event);

  res.send({ status: 'OK' });
});

app.listen(4005, () => {
  console.log('Listening on 4005');
});
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Emitting Post Creation Events

![](section-02/emit-post-creation-events.jpg)

```javascript
// posts/index.js
const posts = {};
app.post('/posts', async (req, res) => {
  const id = randomBytes(4).toString('hex');
  const { title } = req.body;

  posts[id] = {
    id,
    title
  };

  await axios.post('http://localhost:4005/events', {
    type: 'PostCreated',
    data: {
      id,
      title
    }
  });

  res.status(201).send(posts[id]);
});
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Emitting Comment Creation Events

![](section-02/emit-comment-creation-events.jpg)

```javascript
// comments/index.js
const commentsByPostId = {};
app.post('/posts/:id/comments', async (req, res) => {
  const commentId = randomBytes(4).toString('hex');
  const { content } = req.body;

  const comments = commentsByPostId[req.params.id] || [];
  comments.push({ id: commentId, content });
  commentsByPostId[req.params.id] = comments;

  await axios.post('http://localhost:4005/events', {
    type: 'CommentCreated',
    data: {
      id: commentId,
      content,
      postId: req.params.id
    }
  });

  res.status(201).send(comments);
});
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Receiving Events

```javascript
// posts/index.js
// comments/index.js
app.post('/events', (req, res) => {
  console.log('Received Event', req.body.type);

  res.send({});
});
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Creating the Data Query Service

![](section-02/query-service.jpg)

```javascript
// query/index.js
app.get('/posts', (req, res) => {});
app.post('/events', (req, res) => {});
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Parsing Incoming Events

```javascript
// query/index.js
app.get('/posts', (req, res) => {
  res.send(posts);
});

app.post('/events', (req, res) => {
  const { type, data } = req.body;

  if (type === 'PostCreated') {
    const { id, title } = data;

    posts[id] = { id, title, comments: [] };
  }

  if (type === 'CommentCreated') {
    const { id, content, postId } = data;

    const post = posts[postId];
    post.comments.push({ id, content });
  }

  console.log(posts);

  res.send({});
});
```

### Using the Query Service

![](section-02/react-query-service.jpg)

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Adding a Simple Feature

Feature Request

- Add in comment moderation.
- Flag comments that contain the word 'orange'.

Feature Clarifications

- Super easy to implement in the React app, but not if the filter list changes frequently
- Super easy to implement in the existing comments service, but let's assume we want to add a new service
- It might take a long time for the new service to moderate a comment.

### Issues with Comment Filtering

![](section-02/moderation-service-1.jpg)

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### A Second Approach

![](section-02/moderation-service-2.jpg)

- The query service is about presentation logic
- It is joining two resources right now (posts and comments), but it might join 10!
- Does it make sense for a presentation service to understand how to process a very precise update?

### Creating the Moderation Service

```javascript
// moderation/index.js
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const axios = require('axios');

const app = express();
app.use(bodyParser.json());

app.post('/events', (req, res) => {});

app.listen(4003, () => {
  console.log('Listening on 4003');
});
