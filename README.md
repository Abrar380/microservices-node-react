## **Section 01: Fundamental Ideas Around Microservices**

### What Is a Microservice?

A monolith contains

- Routing
- Middleware
- Business Logic
- Database access
to implement all features of our app

![](section-01/monolith-server.jpg)

A single microservice contains

- Routing
- Middleware
- Business Logic
- Database access
to implement one feature of our app

![](section-01/single-microservice.jpg)

### Data in Microservices

Data management between services

- This is the big problem of microservices, and what 90% of this course focuses on

With microservices, we store and access data in sort of strange way. Let's look at 

- how we store data: Each service gets its own database (if it needs one) 
- how we access it: Services will never, ever reach into another services database

![](section-01/store-data.jpg)
![](section-01/access-data.jpg)

Why Database-Per-Service pattern?

- We want each service to run independently of other services
![](section-01/common-database.jpg)
![](section-01/service-dependent.jpg)
- Database schema/structure might change unexpectedly
![](section-01/schema-change.jpg)
- Some services might function more efficiently with different types of DB's (sql vs nosql)

### Sync Communication Between Services

Communication Strategies Between Services
- Sync: Services communicate with each other using direct requests
- Async: Services communicate with each other using events

Notes on Sync Communication
| Pro                              | Con                                                           |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Conceptually easy to understand! | Introduces a dependency between services                      |
| Service D won't need a database! | If any inter-service request fails, the overall request fails |
|                                  | The entire request is only as fast as the slowest request     |
|                                  | Can easily introduce webs of requests                         |

### Async: Event-Based Communication

### Async: A Crazy Way of Storing Data

Service D: Code to show products ordered by a particular user
Let's refine the exact goal of this service
Service D: Given the ID of a user, show the title and image for every product they have ever ordered

### Pros and Cons of Async Communication

| Pros                                               | Cons                 |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Service D has zero dependencies on other services! | Data duplication.    |
| Service D will be extremely fast!                  | Harder to understand |

## **Section 02: A Mini-Microservices App**

### App Overview

Goals

- Get a taste of a microservices architecture
- Build as much as possible from scratch

![](section-02/app-overview-1.jpg)
![](section-02/app-overview-2.jpg)

What services should we create?

- For now, we will create one separate service for each resource in our app
